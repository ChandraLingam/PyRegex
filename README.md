Regular Expression (regex) is a pattern detection language â€“ they are typically used to search patterns in text, extract matching values, and data validation. 

Regex is supported in many programming languages, including Python, C#, JavaScript, Perl, SQL, and more.

### What will you learn in this course?  
1. In just a couple of hours, you will master regular expression language and learn the internals of the regular expression engine  
2. You will apply your new skills with four hands-on, real-world projects  
3. You will gain a solid understanding of the type of performance issues regex can run into, and techniques to address them  
4. As part of resources in this course, you will get a high-quality quick reference guide, an interactive tool, all the source code and downloadable slides

### Why Learn Regular Expressions?  
* Often, the data that we need is not readily accessible or useful.  
* Data preparation and clean-up are one of the most time-consuming activities in a software automation project.   
* Instead of spending time writing code for all this, you can specify data patterns of interest and let regular expression engine do the work for you  
* Regular Expression is cross-platform, and you can learn the concepts once and use it in multiple programming languages and environment  

### Source Code  
* The source code for this course available on Git and that ensures you always get the latest code  

### Ideal Student  
* The ideal student for this course is willing to learn, participate in the course Q&A forum when you need help, and you need to be comfortable coding in Python.
